<p>Fat bikes are a special kind of mountain bike. Pictured above is my Motobecane Lurch.
They are designed to allow a rider to keep riding throughout the winter. They have extra 
wide tires so that they are able to float over the snow instead of sinking in. Once more 
people started riding them they realized that they can be riden all year long. </p>
