<p>The mountain bike pictured above is my Felt Decree. It is a trail/enduro bike designed to 
have a soft ride on both agressive and chunky terrain but still efficient enough to still
pedal well. I have raced this bike in all sorts of events and it did suprisingly well in most
categories. I used it in multiple cross country races in the summer, and pushed it hard for Umaine's
team this past fall in dual slalom, enduro and downhill. </p>
