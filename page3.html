<p> This is a picture of me at the top of the Kancamagus pass in the White Mountains of 
New Hampshire. This Photo was taken after 75 hard miles right before the decent into
Lincoln. These bikes are designed to be as fast as possible on the road compromising 
comfort for speed. This is my Favorite bike I own.  </p>
