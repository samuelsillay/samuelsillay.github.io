<p> Fixed gear bikes or "fixies" are single speed mostly road bikes. They are usually a
blend of road bike style frames but with a more upright position with wide riser bars. 
What makes them the most different from a road bike is the fact that you are unable to 
coast since there is no free-wheel in the rear hub. This makes it more difficult for the 
rider if there are steep hills since you only have one gear but it leaves the rider with
a connected feeling to his/her bike. </p>
